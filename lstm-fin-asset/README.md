# About
- These files are about how to build a time-series model to forecast eft-fund/stock/crypto(asset price) price movement, all of them do the same thing as [MultiVarToManyOutputLSTM.ipynb](https://github.com/technqvi/TimeSeriesML-FinMarket/blob/main/MultiVarToManyOutputLSTM.ipynb) but with different machine learning methods and input/output sequences.
- Mainly, We use several samples from  [flo7up-relataly-public-python-tutorials](https://github.com/flo7up/relataly-public-python-tutorials) to perform on my own experiement.

## Main Files

### [MultiVarToSingleOutLSTM.ipynb](https://github.com/technqvi/TimeSeriesML-FinMarket/blob/main/lstm-fin-asset/MultiVarToSingleOutLSTM.ipynb) 
- Using Multivariate Time Series and Recurrent Neural Networks(LSTM) to forecast price movement in advance.
- Use several input features such as PRice + MA1+ MACD+RSI to forecast one step into the future (Multivariate RNN forecasting models) like  you take data 60 days agoa  to predict in the next 1 day.
